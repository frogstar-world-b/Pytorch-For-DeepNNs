## What is in this folder?
This work is inspired by the [Quickstart](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html) tutorial on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) page.

The base example is a simple feed-forward neural network (FNN) or multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The FashionMNIST dataset (with 10 output classes) is used. The FNN consists of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. In addition to training and testing the model, the base script (`Quickstart_FashionMNIST_FeedForwardNN.py`) also demonstrates how to save a model then load it and make predictions.

The base script is then expanded to include the following techniques:  
- L2 Regularization
- Dropout
- Batch Normalization

Hyperparameter tuning is not included in the code.
